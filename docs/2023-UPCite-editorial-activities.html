## Context
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Université Paris Cité ([ror.org/05f82e368](https://ror.org/05f82e368)) is a new university (2018) located in Paris, France. 

It results from two universities, Université Paris Diderot and Université Paris Descartes, and other institutions such as IPGP (https://ror.org/004gzqz66). It is an omni disciplinary university.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">In the context of the creation of a new publishing platform ([opus.u-paris.fr TBA](https://opus.u-paris.fr)), one of the platform team's objectives was to shade light on the institution's editorial activities, i.e. to answer the following question :
<br >

_In which journals and for which publishers do researchers carry out editorial activities?_
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Editorial activities refers to the activities one may have in a scientific journal, such as Editor-in-Chief, member of the Editorial board or Guest editor. 
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Methods
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Where can the editorial activities of the researchers be figured out ? 

<br />

On the journal's website. The editorial web page of a journal specifies the memberships of the editorial committees. <br/><br/> e.g. [European Annals of Oto-rhino-laryngology, Head and Neck diseases](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/european-annals-of-otorhinolaryngology-head-and-neck-diseases/editorial-board) or [L'année psychologique](https://www.cairn-int.info/journal-l-annee-psychologique.htm?ora.z_ref=cairnSearchAutocomplete&contenu=about)

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### So, only journals are concerned ? 

<br />
Yes. Or more precisely sources with an ISSN, so book collection are also included

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### How do you find out in which journals researchers from your institution are involved ?

<br />

There is the wonderful tool [OpenEditors](https://openeditors.ooir.org/), which crawls journals from 26 publishers. See the [website](https://openeditors.ooir.org), the github [repository](https://github.com/andreaspacher/openeditors) and the preprint : 

<span style="font-size:0.6em;line-height:-10">Nishikawa-Pacher, A., Heck, T., & Schoch, K. (2021, March 11). Open Editors: A Dataset of Scholarly Journals’ Editorial Board Positions. https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jvzq7 </span>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What about journals that are not (yet) indexed by the OpenEditors tool ?

<br />

We noticed that editorial activities are _sometimes_ listed on laboratory websites. Thus, to make this study more accurate, we manually extracted information on laboratory websites (~ 130 laboratory)...
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
... in addition, we found out that some publishers in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) are absent from OpenEditors. HSS often relies on non-international publishers. In France, there are mainly two publishing platforms for the HSS, OpenEdition & Cairn, so we  visited theses platforms and manually extracted the information from the journals' websites.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### It's a lot of work, how much time & people were involved ? 

<br />
About 3 persons for 1 month.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### How do you know that a researcher is part of your university ? 

<br/>

The affiliation, on the web page of the editorial boards, is authoritative. 
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Data collected
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* 363 identified journals
* includind 8 discontinued journals
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### About the editorial activities

<br />

We found out that the way journals decribe their editorial boards is not formalized : there is no common vocabulary (yet ?) to describe editorial activities...
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* We included `Editor in Chief`, `Editorial board`, `Reviewer`, `Publication Director`, `associated editor`, `Editor`
<br /><br />
* We excluded `Scientific Committee`, `Advisor Scientific`, `Guest Editor`, `Emeritus Editor`
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### On the scientific categories 

<br />

We listed the journals following three broad categories, namely, _Health_, _Humanities & Soc sciences_, _Sciences & Techniques_. 

/!\ We deduced the scientific category from the _affiliation_ of the researchers. Basically our university is composed of laboratories that are regrouped in these three categories.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### On scientific organisations

<br />

In order to determine the degree "of autonomy" of th ejournals, we checked wether an institution or association was involved in addition to commercial publishers.
To highlight the "autonomy of journals", we have manually analyzed whether the journal is managed with something else than a publisher. For example, the journal _Natures Sciences Sociétés_ is managed by the association _NSS dialogues_ and relies on the publishing services of _EDP Sciences_.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Distribution of the reviewed journals by type of sci. organisation

|||
|-----------------|----|
| association     | 63 |
| laboratory      | 31 |
| institute       | 4  |
| GIS             | 2  |
| ministry        | 1  |
| graduate school | 1  |

28 % of the journals are managed by a scientific org.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### On economic models

<br />

We classified the economic models of journals according to 6 types : Diamond, Hybrid, Subscription, Gold APC, Delayed OA, S2O
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">#### Distribution of journals according to their economic model
| |  |
|--------------|-----|
| Gold APC     | 113 |
| Hybrid      | 89  |
| Diamond      | 83  |
| Subscription | 66  |
| Delayed OA   | 11  |
| S2O          | 1   |
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### About the article procesing charges (APCs)

<br />

For the journal concerned, we manually extracted the amounts of the APC. We made the conversion to have all the APC in €uros. Wherever a price range or a waiver was indicated, the maximum price was retained.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### On the reviewing activity

<br />

The reviewing activitiy was included as part of our study. However, we noticed that most SHS journals set yp review committees. Therefore, to put the scientific catefories on the same set of standards, 
 review committees are mostly specified by SHS publishers. Therefore, in the interest of fairness across scientific categories, the following results exclude journals for which the university only has a review activity.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Results
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* Discontinued journals are excluded
<br /><br />
* Journals in which the university only has a reviewing activity are excluded
<br /><br />
* HSS (Humanities and Social sciences) should be somewhat overrepresented, as the data was mostly collected manually.
