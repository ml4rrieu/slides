## Context
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Université Paris Cité ([ror.org/05f82e368](https://ror.org/05f82e368)) is a new university (2018) in Paris, France. 

It is the result of the merger of two universities, Université Paris Diderot and Université Paris Descartes, and other institutions such as IPGP (https://ror.org/004gzqz66). It is an omni disciplinary university.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">In the context of the creation of a new publishing platform ([opus.u-paris.fr TBA](https://opus.u-paris.fr)), one of the platform team's objectives was to shed light on the institution's editorial activities, i.e. to answer the following question
<br >

_In which journals and for which publishers do researchers carry out editorial activities?_
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Editorial activities refers to the activities one may have in a scientific journal, such as Editor in Chief, member of the Editorial board, Adviser or Reviewer etc.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Methods
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Where do you find the editorial activities of the researchers ? 

<br />

On the journal's website. The editorial web page of a journal specifies the composition of the editorial committees. <br/><br/> eg. [European Annals of Oto-rhino-laryngology, Head and Neck diseases](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/european-annals-of-otorhinolaryngology-head-and-neck-diseases/editorial-board) or [L'année psychologique](https://www.cairn-int.info/journal-l-annee-psychologique.htm?ora.z_ref=cairnSearchAutocomplete&contenu=about)

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### So, only journals are concerned ? 

<br />
Yes. See this work as "a first stone" and feel free to add to what we have done.. 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### How do you find the journals in which researchers from your institution are involved ?

<br />

There is the wonderful tool [OpenEditors](https://openeditors.ooir.org/) tool, which scrapes journals from 26 publishers. See the [website](https://openeditors.ooir.org), the github [repository](https://github.com/andreaspacher/openeditors) and the preprint : 

<span style="font-size:0.6em;line-height:-10">Nishikawa-Pacher, A., Heck, T., & Schoch, K. (2021, March 11). Open Editors: A Dataset of Scholarly Journals’ Editorial Board Positions. https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jvzq7 </span>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What about journals that are not (yet) inside the OpenEditors tool ?

<br />

We observed that editorial activities are _sometimes_ listed on laboratory websites. Thus, in order to be ~more exhaustive~ less incomplete we manually visited and extracted information on laboratory website (~ 130 laboratory)...
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
... addition, we have found that some publishers in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) are absent from OpenEditors. HSS often publishes with non-international publishers. In France, there are mainly two publishing platforms for the HSS, OpenEdition & Cairn, so we  visited and manually extracted the information from the journals' websites.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### It's a lot of work, how much time & people were involved ? 

<br />
About 3 persons for 1.5 month.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### How do you know that a researcher is part of your university ? 

<br/>

The affiliation, on the web page of the editorial boards, is authoritative. 
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Data collected
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* 363 journals finded
* inclugind 8 discontinued journals
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### On the editorial activities

<br />

We found that the way journals decribe their editorial boards is not formalized : there is no common vocabulary (yet ?) to describe editorial activities...
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* We included `Editor in Chief`, `Editorial board`, `Reviewer`, `Reviewer`, `Publication Director`, `associated editor`, `Editor`
<br /><br />
* We excluded `Scientific Committee`, `Advisor Scientific`, `Guest Editor`, `Emeritus Editor`
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### On the scientific categories 

<br />

We have attached the journals to three broad categories _Health_, _Humanities & Soc sciences_, _Sciences & Techniques_. 

/!\ We have deduced the scientific category with the _affiliation_ of the researchers. Basically our university is composed of laboratories that are regrouped in these three categories.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### On scientific organisations

<br />

To highlight the "autonomy of journals", we have manually analyzed whether the journal is managed with something else than a publisher. For example, the journal _Natures Sciences Sociétés_ is managed by the association _NSS dialogues_ and uses the publishing services of _EDP Sciences_.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Distribution of journals by type of sci. organisation

|||
|-----------------|----|
| association     | 63 |
| laboratoire     | 31 |
| institut        | 4  |
| GIS             | 2  |
| ministere       | 1  |
| ecole doctorale | 1  |

28 % of journals are managed with a scientific org.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### On economic models

<br />

We classified the economic models of journal with 6 types : Diamond, Hybride, Subscription, Gold APC, Delayed OA, S2O
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">#### Distribution of journals by economic model
| |  |
|--------------|-----|
| Gold APC     | 113 |
| Hybride      | 89  |
| Diamond      | 83  |
| Subscription | 66  |
| Delayed OA   | 11  |
| S2O          | 1   |
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### On article procesing charges (APC)

<br />

If any, we have manually indicated the amounts of the APC. We have done the conversion to have all the APC in €uros. Where the journal shows a range (like a waiver option) the maximum has been entered.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### On the reviewing activity

<br />

The reviewing activitiy has been included. However, we found that review committees are mostly specified by SHS publishers. Therefore, in the interest of fairness across scientific categories, the next results exclude journals for which the university has only review activity.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Results
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* Discontinued journals are exclued
<br /><br />
* Journals in which the university has only a reviewing activity are exclued ([see why](2022-UPCite-editorial-activities.md#/3/7))
<br /><br />
* HSS (Humanities and Social sciences) should be somewhat overrepresented, as the data was mostly collected manually.
